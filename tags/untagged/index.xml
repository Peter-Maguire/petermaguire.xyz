It can be controlled either from the device itself or with a companion app on your phone via bluetooth. I purchased mine from ebay at a very reasonable price but with a defect, the onboard controls don&amp;rsquo;t work so you are required to use the app to control it.
The App The ZY Play app is available for iOS or Android, via the Play Store or via a direct APK download from the site.</description></item></channel></rss>
