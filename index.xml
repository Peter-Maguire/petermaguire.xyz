Introduction The Weebill-S is a mirrorless/DSLR camera gimbal made by Zhyiun that retails for around Â£389. It can be controlled either from the device itself or with a companion app on your phone via bluetooth.

The victim is prompted to try out a game from an itch.io link. The download generally contains an archive, usually RAR, which has a password. The password will be given to the victim via Discord, this is to try and evade automated scanning/execution by anyone other than the victim.
An example DM a victim would receive Infection Once the victim has downloaded the archive and extracted it, they will be faced with a Unity game.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://petermaguire.xyz/projects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2022 17:28:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://petermaguire.xyz/projects/</guid><description>OcelotBOT 2013 - Present
